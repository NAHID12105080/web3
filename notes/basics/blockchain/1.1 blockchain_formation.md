## Nonce in Blockchain
- **Nonce** stands for "number only used once" and is a random or semi-random number used in blockchain mining.
- It is a value that miners adjust to find a hash that meets the network's difficulty requirements.
- In proof-of-work systems like Bitcoin, miners change the nonce in each attempt to find a hash that starts with a certain number of zeros (depending on the network difficulty).

## SHA-256 Algorithm
- **SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit)** is a cryptographic hash function that converts an input into a fixed 256-bit hash value.
- **64 hexadecimal characters**, as each hex character equals **4 bits**. (64*4)=256bits
- It is used in blockchain to ensure data integrity, creating a unique "fingerprint" for each block's content.
- The process is one-way, meaning you can't derive the original input from the hash output.
- In blockchain, the hash of a block includes the hash of the previous block, forming a secure and tamper-resistant chain of blocks.

### Example of SHA-256 Hash
If the input is "hello":
*SHA-256("hello") = 2cf24dba5fb0a30e26e83b2ac5b9e29e1b161e5c1fa7425e73043362938b9824*
 **Key Properties**:
 - **Deterministic**: The same input always produces the same output.
 - **Fast Computation**: Easy to compute the hash of any input.
 - **Pre-image Resistance**: Hard to reverse the hash to find the original input.
 - **Collision Resistance**: Unlikely to find two different inputs that produce the same hash.
 - **Avalanche Effect**: Small changes in input produce significantly different outputs.`

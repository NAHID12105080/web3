# Solidity Data Locations: `memory`, `storage`, and `calldata`

Solidity provides three main data locations to specify where variables are stored and how long they persist: `memory`, `storage`, and `calldata`. Each location has specific use cases and implications on gas costs and data persistence.

## 1. `memory`
- **Temporary storage**: Data is stored temporarily in memory during the execution of a function.
- **Non-persistent**: Data stored in `memory` is erased once the function execution ends.
- **Use case**: Suitable for local variables, temporary calculations, and function arguments that do not need to persist after the function call.
- **Example**:
   ```solidity
   function setDynamicData(bytes memory _data) public {
       dynamicData = _data; // _data is stored in memory during the function execution
   }`` 

-   In the above example, `_data` is stored in memory for the duration of the function call and does not persist beyond it.

## 2. `storage`

-   **Persistent storage**: Data is stored on the blockchain, allowing it to persist between function calls.
-   **State variables**: By default, state variables are stored in `storage`.
-   **Expensive gas cost**: Storing data in `storage` is more costly in terms of gas compared to `memory`.
-   **Use case**: Suitable for state variables that need to persist across function calls.
-   **Example**:
    
```solidity
bytes public dynamicData;
function setDynamicData(bytes storage _data) internal {
        dynamicData = _data; // _data references a variable stored on the blockchain
    } 
  ```
-   In this example, `_data` is stored in the blockchain's persistent storage.

## 3. `calldata`

-   **Read-only data location**: `calldata` is used for function parameters that are passed to external functions and cannot be modified.
-   **Immutable**: Data stored in `calldata` cannot be changed within the function.
-   **Lower gas cost**: Since `calldata` is read-only, it is more gas-efficient than `memory` for function parameters.
-   **Use case**: Suitable for function parameters in external functions that are read-only.
-   **Example**:
    
    ```solidity
    function setDynamicData(bytes calldata _data) external {
        // _data is read-only and passed as calldata
    }
    ```
